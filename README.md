### PATHIFY is a python based Path-finding visualiser made with pyGame library for popular Data Structures and Algorithm concepts like A*, DFS, BFS, Djikstra, etc. It focuses on finding the most optimized path for each of the algorithms and ensure smooth data flow. 
## Controls

* First two mouse click to add Source node, End node
* Mouse left click to add walls
* Mouse right click to remove nodes
* Press d to use DFS Algorithm
* Press b to use BFS Algorithm
* Press a to use A* Algorithm
* Press j to use Dijkstra Algorithm
* Press f to use Fibonacci Heap Dijkstra Algorithm
* Press g to generate a random maze
* Press SPACE to pause the algorithm
* Press c to clear board
* Press r to clear board but leave walls, start, end nodes

### Prerequisites

Virtual environments are recommended

```
pip install virtualenv
```

## Running the program

```
python Path_Finding_Visualized.py
```

### Make your own board

You can modify the board size by changing the ROW variable inside main(), enjoy:))
